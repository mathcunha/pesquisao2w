			     Unit Testing
			     ------------

This directory contains unit tests for various JavaGroups classes. The
JUnit framework [1] is used for this. The JUnit JAR file is shipped
with JavaGroups, so users don't have to download JUnit
individually. However, the latest version of JUnit can be found using
the links below.

To compile the files in this directory, a special makefile has been
set up, which includes the junit.jar file in its classpath. However,
if a non-makefile based system is used (e.g. JBuilder), the junit.jar
has to be included in the classpath.

To run the tests, execute ./runtests. Make sure it has the executable
bit set (chmod +x runtests).

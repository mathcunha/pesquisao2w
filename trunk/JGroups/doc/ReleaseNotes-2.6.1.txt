JGroups 2.6.1 is still API-backwards compatible with previous versions (down to 2.2.5).
JGroups 2.6.1 is *binary backwards compatible* with 2.6.

Below is a summary (with links to the detailed description) of the major new features.


FLUSH simplification and bug fixes
----------------------------------
[http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JGRP-624]
[http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JGRP-622]
[http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JGRP-623]

We simplified FLUSH in 2.7, and fixed a number of bugs, which were all backported to 2.6.1


Reincarnation prevention
------------------------
[http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JGRP-637]
[http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JGRP-130]

Reincarnation can be prevented by saving ports in persistent storage and reusing them only after some time. See
http://wiki.jboss.org/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=HandleJoinProblem for how to enabling persistent ports (off by default).


Manual
------
The manual is online at http://www.jgroups.org/javagroupsnew/docs/manual/html/index.html

Bug fixes
---------
Discovery: sometimes, a discovery process would not get interrupted, leading to a long join phase and some
 handleJoin() warning messages.
[http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JGRP-621]

RpcDispatcher with incorrect membership passed as argument to callRemoteMethods() hangs.
[http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JGRP-620]
